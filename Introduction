#Introduction to Linux

## What is Linux?

Linux is a **free and open-source operating system (OS)** developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991 and continues to evolve.  
Since then, Linux has become a global phenomenon, powering everything from supercomputers to servers, mobile phones to personal computers.  
Known for its **stability, security, and flexibility**, Linux is a popular choice for both personal and professional use.

Linux is an operating system similar to **Windows** or **macOS** but differs in how it works and its free, open-source nature.

### The Linux Kernel

At its core lies the **Linux kernel**, which is the central component of the system.  
The kernel is responsible for managing the computer's hardware, such as the **CPU, memory, and peripherals**, and allows all software applications to interact with the physical hardware.

The kernel acts as a **bridge between software applications and computer hardware**.  
When a software application wants to do something hardware-related, like **save a file** or **display something on the screen**, it sends a request to the kernel.  
The kernel translates this request into instructions that the hardware can understand.

### Key Features of Linux

- **Multi-tasking:** Supports running multiple programs at the same time.
- **Multi-user:** Multiple users can use the system simultaneously.
- **Stability and Security:** Widely used for servers due to reliability.
- **Flexibility:** Highly customizable to suit different needs.

### Linux File System

The Linux file system is **hierarchically organized**, starting from the **root directory** (denoted as `/`) and expanding into sub-directories.  
This organization makes it easy to manage and locate files.

### Software Tools & Distributions

Around the kernel, there are many software tools and libraries that add extra functionality.  
These can include:

- **Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)**
- **System Utilities**
- **Application Software**

Users can mix and match these components to create a **Linux distribution** that meets their specific needs.

**Linux distributions** package the kernel with a selection of software to provide a complete operating system ready for use.  
Popular Linux distributions include:

- **Ubuntu**
- **Fedora**
- **CentOS**
